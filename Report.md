# CyberSecurity Report

The report provide a detailed explanation of the work done as part of the project to develop a machine learning model to predict cyberattack.
The project is divided into 3 parts:
1. Data Analysis. The objective of the data analysis was to understand the dataset that will be used as input for our model.
2. Feature Engineering. All the features in the dataset may not be relevant or usable without some data extraction, data transformation and features crossing in order to provide more useful inputs.
3. Model design. Different type of ML model can be used to predict. In this part we explain what model we decided to use and how they compare to each other.
