# Student ML Project on CyberSecurity
This project is made by student of the DSTI school.
The objective is to develop a ML model to predict the type of attack.
The project is divided into 3 main parts:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis.
2. Feature Engineering.
3. Model Development.
The main notebook is a summary of all the work done by the team through the differents steps.
A short website has been made that allow user to drop a csv file with similar data and get the prediction of the attack type using our best model.

 # Installation
 You may clone the repository and then create a virtual environment and installing the required libraries. <br>
 Steps are: <br>
 1- Create virtual environnement using
 ```bash
 python -m venv ./name_of_venv
 ```
 2- Activate virtual environnement:
 ```bash
 source ./name_of_venv/bin/activate
 ```
2- Install libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


# Website 
To run the website, use the following command on the terminal
```bash
Some code here
